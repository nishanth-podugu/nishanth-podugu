    <h1>FLOOD MONITORING AND MITIGATION</h1>
    
    <section>
        <h2>FLOODS</h2>
        <p class="dot">A flood is an overflow of water (or rarely other fluids) that submerges land that is usually dry. 
            In the sense of "flowing water", the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide. 
            Floods are an area of study of the discipline hydrology and are of significant concern in agriculture, civil engineering and public health. 
            Human changes to the environment often increase the intensity and frequency of flooding, for example land use changes such as deforestation and removal of wetlands, changes in waterway course or flood controls such as with levees, and larger environmental issues such as climate change and sea level rise. 
            In particular climate change's increased rainfall and extreme weather events increases the severity of other causes for flooding, resulting in more intense floods and increased flood risk.
            Flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies, such as a river, lake, or ocean, in which the water overtops or breaks levees, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries, or it may occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground in an areal flood. 
            While the size of a lake or other body of water will vary with seasonal changes in precipitation and snow melt, these changes in size are unlikely to be considered significant unless they flood property or drown domestic animals.

            <p style="font-weight: 600; font-style: italic; font-size: larger;">The projects for flood management and control are formulated and implemented by respective state governments/Union Territories from their own resources and as per their priority. Central Government provides financial assistance to states/UTs for implementing some projects in critical areas. Central Govt. has been providing financial assistance through a scheme called Flood Management Programme (FMP) since XI Plan. The scheme since its inception has undergone several changes as per demands of states/UTs and also on account of various directions and policies of Govt. of India.</p>

        <p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: 600; font-style: italic;">Because of the devastating effects that floods can have on people and their environments, flood monitoring systems have been developed to help prepare and warn people of emanating danger. The systems can help prevent excessive damage and loss as a result of flooding and possibly save lives.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>High reliability as data is sent in real-time</li>
            <li>Timely detection of flood risks</li>
            <li>Tailored solutions that can easily be integrated with external development at any level such as connectivity, user application, and device.</li>

            <p style="font-size: larger;
            font-weight: 600;
            font-style: italic;">A flood risk assessment (FRA) is an assessment of the risk of flooding from all flooding mechanisms, the identification of flood mitigation measures and should provide advice on actions to be taken before and during a flood.<br>
                The sources of water which produce floods include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Groundwater (saturated groundwater)</li>
                    <li>Vadose (water flowing the ground in an unsaturated state)</li>
                    <li>Surface water</li>
                    <li>Artificial water (burst water mains, canals or reservoirs)</li>
                    <li>Rivers, streams or watercourses</li>
                    <li>Sewers and drains</li>
                    <li>Flooding of low-lying coastal regions due to sea level rise</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: 600; font-style: italic;">For each of the sources of water, different hydraulic intensities occur. Floods can occur because of a combination of sources of flooding, such as high groundwater and an inadequate surface water drainage system. The topography, hydrogeology and physical attributes of the existing or proposed development need to be considered. A flood risk assessment should be an evaluation of the flood risk and the consequences and impact and vulnerability.

                    Non-professional flood risk assessments can be produced by members of the public, Architects, environment assessors, or others who are not specifically professionally qualified in this field. However, it is a complex evaluation and such assessments they can be rejected by Authorities as inadequate, or could be considered as negligent in the event of a flooding event, damage and a claim to insurers being made.</p>

        <ul>
        <li><h3 style="font-size: larger; font-style: italic; padding: 13px;">What Are The Methods To Control Flooding?</h3></li>
        
        <p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: 600; font-style: italic; padding-bottom: 5px;">The flood control measures generally consists of two approaches:-</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Construction of high earthen walls along the banks of the river to protect the adjacent areas from over spillage. This type of flood control measure can be adopted for a particular length of the river, where the river passes through densely populated areas, because otherwise, it will not be economical.</li>
            <li>Storing excess rainwater during heavy rains at appropriate places along the path of the river to reduce the river flow downstream. This type of flood control measure may be achieved by constructing a dam-type obstruction across the river and storing water in the upstream portion to form a reservoir. The stored water can be released when there is no heavy rainfall, and the natural flow of the river is less.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: 600; font-style: italic; padding-bottom: 5px;">Some of the methods used for flood control are:-</p>
        <ul>
        <dl>
           <li><dt>Flood Control by constructing dikes and flood walls</dt></li>
           <dd style="font-size: larger; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic;">Dikes, also called levees, are earthen embankments that are raised parallel to the river flow at some suitable distance from the deep river. Such embankments are raised either on both sides of the river or only on one side for some suitable river length where the river passes through towns and cities or other densely populated places. These embankments retain and confine the flood water in between them and help in flood control by preventing it from spreading into adjacent lands.</dd>
           <li><dt>Flood control by construction of storage tanks and reservoirs</dt></li>
           <dd style="font-size: larger; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic;">Reservoir is formed upstream when a dam or a bund is built across a river. Such a reservoir will store ample water that enters the river upstream of the dam. The consequent storage capacity of the reservoir helps absorb excess runoff, thereby avoiding excess flows downstream of the dam and thus helps in flood control. Several times small earthen bunds are raised across the river streams, particularly in the head reaches, to create such storages. These small reservoirs are generally called tanks. When a big dam is constructed across a river to create a huge lake upstream, the reservoir formed is known as a large reservoir. When these large reservoirs are constructed to absorb flood waters, it is called flood control reservoir. But when it is constructed for several uses, such as flood control, irrigation, hydel power generation etc., then it is called a multipurpose reservoir.</dd>
           <li><dt>Flood control by soil conservation methods</dt></li>
           <dd style="font-size: larger; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic;">This method of flood control can be done by providing vegetative cover near the banks of the river or any area of importance prone to flooding. The vegetation and the soil can absorb the water of the flood and thus helps in flood control. This method of flood control is also helpful in recharging the groundwater and preventing the soil from erosion. </dd>

        <p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: 600; font-style: italic; padding-bottom: 5px;">There are some ways.Those are:</p>
        <ul>
        <dl>
            <li><dt>Flood preparedness, relief and recovery</dt></li>
            <dd style="font-size: larger; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic;">Despite implementing all flood control measures, floods may occur because they cannot be completely eliminated. As a result, flood preparedness, relief, and recovery must be planned ahead of time to meet any disaster and minimize loss of life and property. Generally, such preparedness includes measures such as:- flood forecasting, flood warning, flood fighting, evacuation planning, community shelter for people, relief camps etc. Out of these attributes, the flood warning is the most vital one. Timely flood warning predictions by the flood forecasting department can help reduce the after-effects of the disastrous flood.</dd>
            <li><dt>Afforestation and Reforestation</dt></li>
            <dd style="font-size: larger; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic;">Afforestation is the process of introducing trees and tree seedlings to previously unforested areas. Afforestation can be accomplished through natural or artificial tree planting and seeding. Similarly, afforestation can be thought of as reforestation. The conversion of a non-forested area to a forested area through tree planting and seeding is known as reforestation. The distinction is that reforestation is the restoration of a deforested area. There is greater interception and lower river discharge when trees are planted in the drainage basin. It also contributes to the overall environmental quality of the river's surroundings. While afforestation can help to reduce flood risks, it cannot completely eliminate flooding.</dd>
            <li><dt>Rainwater harvesting</dt></li>
            <dd style="font-size: larger; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic;">Rainwater harvesting is the process of collecting, storing, transporting, and purifying the rainwater that can be collected from rooftops, parks, roads, and open spaces for later use. This technique of collecting rainwater helps reduce the stormwater runoff in the drainage systems, which ultimately reduces the chances of occurrence of flood. This technique should be mandatory in every building which is prone to floods.</dd>
            <li><dt>River Interlinking</dt></li>
            <dd style="font-size: larger; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic;">This technique is used to transfer excess water from a river to another river prone to drought. With the help of this technique, the excess water from a river can be transferred, reducing the stage of the river. Thus, saving that river from flooding conditions. This technique also helps revive those rivers prone to drought during most of the year. One of the major examples of river interlinking is the ken-betwa interlinking project</dd>
